  QualifiedIdentifier:
    description: >-
      A non-NMDC identifier for something that is also present in the NMDC database.
      Provides support for saying when the identifier was asserted and assessments about
      the quality of the identifier.

slots:
  external_identifier_value:
    description: This is the value of the identifier used in some external system
    range: uriorcurie
    comments:
      - Using a uriorcurie range ensures that we can consistently and atomically
        assert the source of the mapping and the local identifier (without requiring
        even more classes).
      - Using a uriorcurie range does require that we define prefixes for all
        external systems that we might map to. Prefixes from an external system
        like are strongly preferred. Ideally the CURIes expand to a resolvable
        URL, but this is not required.
      - using curie as the range leads to "WARNING:root:UNKNOWN: Curie // <class 'linkml_runtime.utils.yamlutils.extended_str'>" when building the project... maybe from gen-owl?
  provenance:
    range: string
    description: >-
      comments about whether the mapping is 1:1 (from NMDC to the external system),
      many:1, 1:many, or many:many.
      - would we ever assert a many:many mapping?
      - use an enumeration and add some other comment-like string field?
  assertion_date:
    range: string
    description: >-
      A string representation of an ISO-8601 data when the mapping was asserted.
    comments: provide a pattern? see if date/time objects work in LinkML now?
  has_qualified_identifiers:
    range: QualifiedIdentifier
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      A link from any (NamedTing?) in the NMDC database to an external identifier
      This would replace alternative identifiers, related identifiers, etc.
